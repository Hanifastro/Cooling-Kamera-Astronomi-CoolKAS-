# CoolKAS : Cooling Camera Astronomy
## Description :
CoolKAS, short for Cooling Camera Astronomy, is a sophisticated system designed to cool down DSLR camera sensors using a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) mechanism, coupled with a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for precise temperature regulation. The system operates through a Wi-Fi interface accessible via a web server, providing users with remote control over the cooling process. Additionally, the web server displays real-time temperature graphs, power consumption data, and Sky Quality Meter (SQM) readings, offering astronomers comprehensive insights into environmental conditions.
## Key Features:
-Thermoelectric Cooling              : Utilizes a thermoelectric cooler to achieve precise and efficient cooling of DSLR camera sensors.
-PID Temperature Control             : Employs a PID controller to maintain stable and accurate temperatures, ensuring optimal performance.
-Web Interface                       : Accessible via Wi-Fi connection, enabling remote monitoring and control of the cooling system through a user-friendly web server interface.
-Real-Time Data Display              : Provides users with real-time temperature graphs, power consumption metrics, and Sky Quality Meter readings for comprehensive analysis and monitoring.
-Integration with Sky Quality Meter  : Seamlessly integrates with Sky Quality Meter devices to incorporate environmental light pollution data into the cooling process.
## Usage :
To utilize CoolKAS, users need to connect their DSLR camera to the cooling system and access the web server interface through a Wi-Fi connection. From the web interface, users can set desired temperature levels, monitor temperature graphs, view power consumption data, and access Sky Quality Meter readings. Additionally, CoolKAS allows for seamless integration with Sky Quality Meter devices, enhancing the overall functionality and accuracy of astronomical observations.
